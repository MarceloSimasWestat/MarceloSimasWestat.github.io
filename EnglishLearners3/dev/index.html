                  Proficiency on assessments is an indicator of readiness for more advanced learning. The frameworks for the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) mathematics and reading assessments illustrate this concept. For example, the mathematics framework indicates that students in grade 4 should understand whole numbers, while students in grade 8 should be able to work with rational numbers, and students in 12th grade should be familiar with more complex mathematical concepts such as exponents and logarithms.<sup>1</sup> Similarly, for reading, students are assessed with progressively more complex texts as they progress through school.<sup>2</sup> On-time graduation, meanwhile, is an indicator of readiness for post-secondary activities, such as college, employment, and military service. In addition, a high school diploma also yields tangible benefits such as higher earnings and a lower rate of unemployment than for those without a diploma.<sup>3</sup> However, while the number of English learners (ELs) in the nation's schools continues to increase,<sup>4</sup> ELs consistently score lower on national assessments and graduate at lower rates than students in the country as a whole.<sup>5</sup>

                <p>
                  NAEP provides a common metric of student achievement across all states and selected urban districts, which participate under the Trial Urban District Assessment (TUDA). Data from NAEP clearly show that ELs lag far behind non-ELs in mathematics as well as English. In the recently released data from the 2017 assessment, the percentage of ELs scoring at or above proficient ranged from 8 percent for 8th grade reading to 15 percent for 4th grade mathematics, 28 to 40 percentage points below the percent proficient for non-ELs.<sup>6</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The analyses below utilize data from NAEP how EL proficiency rates on NAEP grade 4 and 8 mathematics and reading have changed over time. Although NAEP provides a common measurement tool across states, states vary in terms of exclusion criteria and available accomodations for ELs.<sup>7</sup> As a result, interpreting EL performance differences across states is complex, and any comparisons must be made with caution. The analyses also examine how ELs in the TUDA districts performed on those NAEP assessments in 2017.

In 7 of those states, the increase was more than 3 percentage points. For grade 8 mathematics, 31 states had data available for comparison between 2009 and 2017. Nine of those 31 states had an increase in the percent of ELs scoring at or above Proficient of more than 1 percentage point, and, of those states, only 2 had increases greater than 3 percentage points.

                <p>
                  Graduating from high school is an achievement with tangible benefits. In 2017, adults with a high school diploma (including high school equivalency credentials) but no college attainment earned 27 percent more than adults without a high school diploma: $712 per week, on average, compared to $520 per week, respectively. Additionally, having a high school diploma or its equivalent means greater likelihood of employment and protection from economic downturns; in 2017, 4.6 percent of adults with a high school credential and no further education were unemployed, compared to 6.5 percent of adults with no high school diploma.<sup>8</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The analyses below utilize four-year cohort graduation rate data to examine the rate at which ELs graduate from high school within four years in comparison with their non-EL cohorts, and how the graduation rate for ELs has changed over time.

                    In 2015-16, at the state-level, EL graduation rates varied widely (32 to 92 percent). Fewer than 80 percent of ELs graduated within four years in all but three states, while in 16 states, fewer than 60 percent of ELs graduated within four years. In six of those states, less than half of ELs graduated within four years. This variation may, in part, reflect differences in state implementation of the standard rate. For example, states decide which students to include in their EL cohort. For example, states that include all students identified as ELs in 9th grade, regardless of English proficiency at the time of graduation, may have a higher EL graduation rate than those who include only those students identified as ELs in 12th grade.<sup>9</sup>

                    In most (35) states, the graduation rate of ELs was higher in 2015-16 than in 2010-11. Nationally, the EL graduation rate increased 10 percentage points from 2010-11 to 2015-16, however ELs still graduate from high school at rate (67 percent) substantially below that of their English speaking peers (85 percent, a difference of 18 percentage points).<sup>10</sup>

                  From early on in their education, ELs do not perform as well as their non-EL counterparts on tests of academic proficiency in mathematics and reading. The change in proficiency rates on NAEP grade 4 and grade 8 math and reading assessments between 2009 and 2017 varied by state, with some states reporting increased proficiency rates and others reporting decreased proficiency rates. In addition, in all of the TUDA districts, the majority of ELs were not Proficient on the NAEP assessments. Overall, ELs continue to be outperformed by non-ELs on the NAEP assessments, a trend which is also reflected in on-time graduation rates. While the percentage of ELs graduating within four years increased between 2010-11 and 2015-16, the rates varied widely by state and ELs continued to be less likely than non-ELs to graduate on time, with fewer than 80 percent of ELs graduating on time in most states in 2015-16.

                  <strong>National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) proficiency:</strong> NAEP mathematics and reading assessments are given to students in grades 4 and 8 every two years. The NAEP mathematics assessments covers five content areas: number properties and operations; measurement; geometry; data analysis, statistics, and probability; and algebra. Proficiency in grade 4 indicates students are able to consistently apply integrated procedural knowledge and conceptual understanding to problem solving in the five content areas, while proficiency in grade 8 indicates students are able to apply mathematical concepts and procedures consistently to complex problems in the five content areas.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The NAEP reading assessments measures reading and comprehension skills by asking students to read grade-appropriate passages and answer questions based on those passages. Proficiency in grade 4 indicates students are able to integrate and interpret texts and apply their understanding of the text to draw conclusions and make evaluations, while proficiency in grade 8 indicates students are able to: provide relevant information and summarize main ideas and themes; make and support inferences about a text, connect parts of a text, and analyze text features; and fully substantiate judgments about content and presentation of content.
                </p>

                  <strong>Graduation rates:</strong> State-level four-year adjusted-cohort graduation rates and cohort sizes for ELs and all students were obtained from EDFacts, regulatory four-year adjusted-cohort graduation rate table (Data Group 695) and cohorts for regulatory four-year adjusted-cohort graduation rate table (Data Group 696). The four-year adjusted-cohort graduation rate is the number of students who graduate in four years or less with a regular high school diploma divided by the number of students who formed the cohort. The number of graduating students in each state was estimated by multiplying the number of students in the cohort by the graduation rate. The number of non-ELs in the cohort was derived by subtracting the number of ELs in the cohort from the number of all students in the cohort, and the number of graduating non-ELs was estimated by subtracting the estimated number of graduating ELs from the estimated number of all graduating students. The graduation rate for non-ELs was then calculated by dividing the estimated number of graduating non-ELs by the derived number of non-ELs in the cohort.

                <p>
                  The national graduation rates reported in this data story reflect the 50 states and the District of Columbia only.
