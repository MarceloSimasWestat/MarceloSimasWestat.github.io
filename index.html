                <h2 class="line">New Data Illuminates the Extent of Chronic Absenteeism</h2>
                <p class="afterHeader">

                    Education can only fulfill its promise as the great equalizer—a force that can
                     overcome differences in privilege and background—when we work to ensure that
                      students are in school every day and receive
                    the supports they need to learn and thrive.    </p>
                <p>

                    At the same time, we know that many students experience tremendous
                    adversity in their lives—including poverty, health challenges,
                    community violence, and difficult family circumstances—that make
                    it difficult for them to get to school every day to take advantage of
                    opportunities to learn and grow.
                </p>



                <p>Students who are chronically absent—meaning they miss at least
                  15 days of school in a year—are at serious risk of falling behind
                  in school. Yet too few states report information about chronic absenteeism, and
                  for too long this crisis in our nation’s public elementary and secondary schools has not
                   been fully understood. The release of the Department’s 2013-14 Civil Rights Data
                    Collection (CRDC) marks a turning point in the effort to reduce and ultimately eliminate chronic
                     absenteeism so that all students can reach their full potential. For the first time, the CRDC provides insight on students who miss at least three weeks of
                      school. 99.5 percent of all public schools are represented in the data collection, resulting in
                       the most comprehensive portrait of chronic absenteeism at the school level in our country to date.</p>

                <p style="margin-bottom:3.5em;">

                  This interactive data story analyzes these new data to explore who is most impacted by chronic absenteeism,
                  when in the educational continuum it tends to be severe, and how chronic absenteeism compares
                  in cities and towns across the country.

                <p style="margin-top:1.5em; margin-bottom:3.5em;">Let’s take a closer look at which groups of students are more
                  likely to be chronically absent. Disparities in chronic absenteeism by key demographic
                  characteristics are evident, though unacceptable levels of chronic absenteeism exist for
                  all students.</p>

                <p style="margin-top:1.5em;">The disparities are striking. Consider the relative differences: compared to their white peers, American Indian and Pacific Islander students were over 50 percent more likely to lose three weeks of school or more, black students 30 percent more likely, and Hispanic students 9 percent more likely.</p>

                <p style="margin-top:1.5em;">One notable trend: English learners, who face significant barriers in school and society, were 1.2 times less likely to be chronically absent than their non-English learner peers. Less than 11 percent of English learners are chronically absent compared to more than 13 percent of non-English learners.</p>

                <p>The same was not true for students with disabilities who were 1.3 times more likely to be chronically absent than students without disabilities. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is intended to ensure all students with disabilities have access to a free, appropriate education yet chronic absenteeism complicates efforts toward that goal.</p>

                <p>At roughly 13 percent each, male and female students were similarly likely to be chronically absent. </div>

                    Chronic absenteeism occurs at every grade level but was more prevalent in some grades than others. Chronic absenteeism rates were highest in high school, according to data in the 2013-14 Civil Rights Data Collection. Other research suggests that students in the early elementary grades also experience high rates of chronic absenteeism, which may be masked in analyses that are only available at the school level (as is the case here).
                    Understanding when students are most at risk will help schools and advocates better target interventions to improve student outcomes.

                <p style="margin-top: 1.5em;">Overall, almost 20 percent of students in high school were chronically absent
                  compared to nearly 12
                   percent of students in middle school. Students in elementary schools
                    had the lowest chronic absenteeism rate at 10 percent.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 3.5;">Next, we looked at how chronic absenteeism
                  varied across grade levels for specific groups of students.</p>

                    For each subgroup of students there was a similar pattern: the likelihood of chronic absenteeism increases as students progress into high school. Notably, the stronger overall attendance observed among English learners dissipates over grade levels, such that they experience higher chronic absenteeism than their non-English learner peers when they reach high school.

                <h2 class="line">Why Chronic Absenteeism Matters: What the Research Says</h2>
                <p>Chronic absenteeism is
                  widespread—almost one out of every eight students missed three weeks or more of school in
                   2013-14. That translates to 93 million school days lost. Research suggests the reasons for chronic absenteeism are as varied as the challenges our
                  students and families face—including health, transportation, and
                  safety—which can be particularly acute in disadvantaged communities
                  and areas of concentrated poverty.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 3.5em;">Whatever its causes, chronic absenteeism can be devastating:</p>

                        <h3 class="icon style1 fa-book">Chronic absenteeism may prevent children from reaching early learning milestones.</h3>
                        <p>Children who are chronically absent in preschool, kindergarten, and first grade are much less likely to read at grade level by the third grade. Students who cannot read at grade level by the end of third grade are four times more likely than proficient readers to drop out of high school.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 12px;">Schools with incomplete or inconsistent values for the data needed for the chronic student absenteeism analyses were excluded. A total of 4,455 schools were excluded for the following reasons:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The chronic absenteeism question was not applicable to the school (the school must have students enrolled in grades K–12).</li>
          <li>The school reported incomplete data for enrollment and/or the chronic absenteeism count for at least one race/ethnicity subgroup.</li>
          <li>The chronic absenteeism count was larger than the K–12 enrollment for at least one race/ethnicity subgroup. Schools with partial or missing data for students with disabilities or English learners were included in all analyses except those that focused on these subgroups.</li>
