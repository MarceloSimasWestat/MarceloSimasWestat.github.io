                <p>
                    For English Learners, access to early learning opportunities such as preschool can have important benefits. A study conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California found that English Learners participating in center-based care and, particularly, high-quality care, exhibit improvements in early reading skills, <sup>1</sup> while other studies suggest that dual-language learner children may benefit more from center-based care relative to their English-speaking peers.<sup>2</sup> Furthermore, a consensus statement from a task force of interdisciplinary scientists who reviewed evidence on the impact of state-funded pre-kindergarten programs indicated that dual-language learners "can experience especially rapid growth in early learning when exposed to supportive and rich learning opportunities in pre-k."<sup>3</sup> Data from the 2013–14 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) reveal that, while most ELs had access to preschool, few were actually enrolled in preschool.

                    In comparison with non-ELs, ELs were slightly more likely to have access to preschool programs in 2013–14. Ninety-three percent of ELs enrolled in schools offering pre-K through Grade 2 were enrolled in districts that provided preschool programs or services, compared to 89 percent of non-ELs. ELs were also more likely to have access to free preschool programs and full-day preschool programs than non-ELs; 87 percent of the ELs enrolled in schools offering pre-K through Grade 2 were enrolled in districts offering free preschool programs compared to 81 percent of non-ELs, while 59 percent of ELs were enrolled in districts that provide full-day preschool programs compared to 55 percent of non-ELs.

                    Although ELs had greater access to preschool programs in 2013–14, a lower percentage of ELs enrolled in preschool compared to non-ELs. In 2013–14, 13 percent of preschool-aged ELs enrolled in preschool, while 19 percent of preschool-aged non-ELs were enrolled in preschool.

                <p>
                  Participation in advanced coursework, such as Algebra 1 in middle school and Physics, Chemistry, and Calculus in high school, can help prepare students for college and careers. Using data from two cohorts of high school students in Utah, researchers found that taking and passing Advanced Placement exams has positive impacts on students' ACT scores.<sup>4</sup> Similarly, a study conducted by the Iowa Department of Education identified a positive relationship between students taking higher level mathematics courses and ACT mathematics scores across race/ethnicity groups and genders.<sup>5</sup> ACT scores are used by many institutions of higher education as a criteria for admission. In terms of advanced coursework at the middle school level, researchers examining the impact of the Wake County Public School System in North Carolina, which instituted rules to determine which middle school students to place into advanced mathematics courses, found that "those pushed into accelerated math courses were 20 percentage points more likely to describe themselves in 10th grade as intending to enroll in a four-year college, even after many had already left the accelerated track."<sup>6</sup> While it appears that participation in advanced coursework has positive impacts on student outcomes, data show that ELs are less likely to participate in advanced coursework than non-ELs.

                  In 2013–14, most ELs and non-ELs in Grades 7 and 8 were enrolled in schools that offered Algebra 1. Similarly, most ELs and non-ELs in Grades 9 through 12 were enrolled in schools that offered Physics, Chemistry, or Calculus. However, looking at actual enrollment in those courses, non-ELs were more likely than ELs to be enrolled. For example, non-ELs were more than twice as likely to be enrolled in Algebra 1 than ELs - 9 percent compared to 4 percent. About 10 percent of non-ELs were enrolled in Physics compared to 6 percent of ELs. Seventeen percent of non-ELs were enrolled in Chemistry in comparison with 11 percent of ELs. While less than four percent of both groups were enrolled in Calculus, only 1 percent of ELs were enrolled in Calculus.

                  More than 60 percent of middle schools offered Algebra 1, while more than 60 percent of high schools offered Physics and Chemistry and slightly less than 50 percent of high schools offered Calculus. Across these subjects, the percentage of schools offering the course decreased as the concentration of ELs in the school increased, indicating that ELs were less likely to be able to access advanced courses. For example, more than 70 percent of middle schools with low concentrations of ELs offered Algebra I, while only 55 percent of middle schools with high concentrations of ELs did so. Similarly, 77 percent of low EL concentration high schools offered physics compared to 41 percent of high EL concentration high schools, while 87 percent of low EL concentration high schools offered chemistry compared to 51 percent of high EL concentration high schools. For Calculus, 66 percent of low EL concentration high schools offered the course, compared to just 28 percent of high EL concentration high schools.

                  ELs were more than 5 percent of the total students enrolled in schools offering Algebra I, Physics, Chemistry, or Calculus. However, in terms of actual enrollment in those courses, ELs were less represented than expected. For example, although 7 percent of enrollment in schools offering Algebra 1 were ELs, ELs were only 4 percent of the students enrolled in Algebra 1. ELs were about 5 percent of enrollment in schools offering Physics, Chemistry, or Calculus, but comprised 4 percent of enrollment in Physics and Chemistry, and just 1 percent of enrollment in Calculus.

                  Dual enrollment programs are designed for high school students to enroll in college courses for credit prior to high school graduation. A study on a dual enrollment program in Washington State found that students who participated in the program were more likely to attend college after graduating,<sup>7</sup> while the Community College Research Center, studying students from Florida and New York, found that career and technical education students participating in dual enrollment experienced positive impacts lasting through college; those who participated in dual enrollment programs attained higher grades and accumulated credits at a quicker pace than those who did not.<sup>8</sup> Although dual enrollment programs could have positive impacts for English Learners, data reveal that English Learners were less likely to have access to dual enrollment programs than their non-English Learner counterparts.

However, high schools with higher concentrations of ELs were less likely to offer dual enrollment than high schools with lower concentrations of ELs. More than 60 percent of low EL concentration high schools offered dual enrollment in 2013–14, while 42 percent of high schools with medium concentrations of ELs and only 30 percent of high schools with high concentrations of ELs offered dual enrollment 2013–14.

                  Sixty-four percent of high school students in 2013–14 were enrolled in high schools that offered dual enrollment. However, reflecting the data that suggest that ELs were less likely to be able to access dual enrollment options than non-ELs, ELs were less likely to be enrolled in schools that offered dual enrollment. Just over half - 53 percent - of ELs in high school were enrolled in high schools that offered dual enrollment in 2013–14. In comparison, 64 percent of non-ELs were enrolled in high schools that offered dual enrollment options.

                  Almost all ELs in 2014–15 participated in an LIEP. Out of the 4.8 million ELs in 2014–15, 97 percent, or more than 4.6 million, participated in an LIEP. Of those particiating in an LIEP, the vast majority - 78 percent, or 3.6 million, were Hispanic; 11 percent, or about 500,000 were Asian; and 6 percent, or about 270,000 were White. The high percentage of ELs participating in an LIEP suggests that these programs are reaching the intended population.

                <p>A district might have “null/missing data” indicated on the maps, or may not appear on the maps, if</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>the district has missing EL enrollment, LIEP enrollment, or total student membership;</li>
                    <li>the district has more than 100 percent of its students reported as ELs;</li>
                    <li>the district did not match with the National Center for Education Statistics’ district boundary file; or</li>
                    <li>the data were suppressed for privacy protection (fewer than six students enrolled).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    The map showing the percentages of students who are ELs is based on EL enrollment counts from EDFacts and total student enrollment from the Common Core of Data (CCD). Because of data quality concerns, this map uses Rhode Island’s and Vermont’s school-level EL enrollment aggregated to the LEA-level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The map showing the percentage change in the number of ELs enrolled in an English language instruction educational program (LIEP) uses publicly available data from the Common Core of Data (CCD). Note that not all ELs are enrolled in LIEP. Illinois and Mississippi have missing data for almost all districts. In addition, because Vermont reports LIEP enrollment only for supervisory unions and such enrollment cannot be attributed to districts, the map suggests Vermont has no ELs in LIEP. However, because of the way Vermont reports its data, the percentage change in LIEP cannot be calculated.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the maps, the label <strong>“Elementary”</strong> includes all school districts that are financially responsible for providing education only to children in the elementary grades. Some elementary school districts share territory with one or more secondary school districts. The label <strong>“Independent Elementary”</strong> refers to those elementary school districts that are geographically independent of other school districts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The label <strong>“Secondary”</strong> includes all school districts that are financially responsible for providing education only to children in grades above the elementary grades. This includes pseudo-secondary school districts created by the U.S. Census Bureau.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The label <strong>“Unified”</strong> refers to districts that provide education to children of all school ages. In general, where there is a unified school district, no elementary or secondary school district exists.
                </p>
