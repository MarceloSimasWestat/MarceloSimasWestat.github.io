                <p>
                  For English Learners, access to early learning opportunities such as preschool can have important benefits. A 2012 study conducted found that English Learners participating in center-based care and, particularly, high-quality care, exhibit improvements in early reading skills, <sup>1</sup> while other studies suggest that dual-language learner children may benefit more from center-based care relative to their English-speaking peers.<sup>2</sup> Furthermore, dual-language learners can exhibit rapid growth in early learning and improve English proficiency and other academic skills.<sup>3</sup> The analyses below utilize data from the 2013–14 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) to explore the level of access to and utilization of preschool. The CRDC defines preschool as including preschool programs and services for children ages 3 to 5, and this data story estimates the size of the population of preschool-aged children using the number of children enrolled in Grades 1 or 2.

                  The analysis in the chart above estimates the percentage of students enrolled in a particular type of district by using the number of students enrolled in schools that had any of pre-K through Grade 2. In comparison with non-ELs, ELs were slightly more likely to have access to preschool programs in 2013–14. Ninety-three percent of ELs enrolled in schools with pre-K through Grade 2 were enrolled in districts that provided preschool programs or services, compared to 89 percent of non-ELs. ELs were also more likely to have access to free preschool programs and full-day preschool programs than non-ELs; 87 percent of the ELs enrolled in schools with pre-K through Grade 2 were enrolled in districts providing free preschool programs compared to 81 percent of non-ELs, while 59 percent of ELs were enrolled in districts that provide full-day preschool programs compared to 55 percent of non-ELs.

                  Although ELs had greater access to preschool programs in 2013–14, a lower percentage of ELs enrolled in preschool compared to non-ELs. In 2013–14, 13 percent of preschool-aged ELs enrolled in preschool, while 19 percent of preschool-aged non-ELs were enrolled in preschool.

                  Among the EL and non-EL preschoolers in 2013–14, similar percentages of were enrolled in districts that provided free preschool and full-day preschool. For both groups of students, more than 90 percent were enrolled in districts that provided free preschool, while about two-thirds were enrolled in districts that provided full-day preschool.

                  In 2013–14, 12 percent of all preschoolers enrolled were ELs. In districts that provided free preschool options, about 13 percent of the preschoolers enrolled were ELs. However, in districts that only provided preschool at cost, ELs comprised just 4 percent of the total preschoolers enrolled. The percentage of preschoolers enrolled who were ELs did not vary much based on the length of preschool options provided by the district.

                <p>
                  Participation in advanced coursework, such as Algebra 1 in middle school and Physics, Chemistry, and Calculus in high school, can help prepare students for college and careers. Researchers have found that taking and passing Advanced Placement exams has positive impacts on students' ACT scores<sup>4</sup>, and identified a positive relationship between students taking higher level mathematics courses and ACT mathematics scores across race/ethnicity groups and genders.<sup>5</sup> ACT scores are used by many institutions of higher education as a criteria for admission. In terms of advanced coursework at the middle school level, a study found that students enrolled in advanced mathematics courses in middle school were more likely to describe themselves in 10th grade as intending to enroll in a four-year college<sup>6</sup> While it appears that participation in advanced coursework has positive impacts on student outcomes, data reveal that ELs are less likely to participate in advanced coursework than non-ELs.

                  In 2013–14, most ELs and non-ELs in Grades 7 and 8 were enrolled in schools that offered Algebra 1. Similarly, most ELs and non-ELs in Grades 9 through 12 were enrolled in schools that offered Physics, Chemistry, or Calculus. However, looking at actual enrollment in those courses, non-ELs were more likely than ELs to be enrolled. For example, non-ELs were more than twice as likely to be enrolled in Algebra 1 than ELs - 9 percent compared to 4 percent. About 10 percent of non-ELs were enrolled in Physics compared to 6 percent of ELs. Seventeen percent of non-ELs were enrolled in Chemistry in comparison with 11 percent of ELs. While less than four percent of both groups were enrolled in Calculus, only 1 percent of ELs were enrolled in Calculus.

                  More than 60 percent of middle schools offered Algebra 1, while more than 60 percent of high schools offered Physics and Chemistry and slightly less than 50 percent of high schools offered Calculus. Across these subjects, the percentage of schools offering the course decreased as the concentration of ELs in the school increased, indicating that ELs were less likely to be able to access advanced courses. For example, more than 70 percent of middle schools with low concentrations of ELs offered Algebra I, while only 55 percent of middle schools with high concentrations of ELs did so. Similarly, 77 percent of low EL concentration high schools offered physics compared to 41 percent of high EL concentration high schools, while 87 percent of low EL concentration high schools offered chemistry compared to 51 percent of high EL concentration high schools. For Calculus, 66 percent of low EL concentration high schools offered the course, compared to just 28 percent of high EL concentration high schools.

                  ELs were more than 5 percent of the total students enrolled in schools offering Algebra I, Physics, Chemistry, or Calculus. However, in terms of actual enrollment in those courses, ELs were less represented than expected. For example, although 7 percent of enrollment in schools offering Algebra 1 were ELs, ELs were only 4 percent of the students enrolled in Algebra 1. ELs were about 5 percent of enrollment in schools offering Physics, Chemistry, or Calculus, but comprised 4 percent of enrollment in Physics and Chemistry, and just 1 percent of enrollment in Calculus.

                  Dual enrollment programs are designed for high school students to enroll in college courses for credit prior to high school graduation. Students in dual enrollment may be more likely to attend college after graduating.<sup>7</sup> In addition, dual enrollment program participants may experience benefits that last into their college careers; research on those enrolled in dual enrollment programs found that they attained higher grades and accumulated credits at a quicker pace than those who did not.<sup>8</sup> Although dual enrollment programs could have positive impacts for English Learners, data show that English Learners were less likely to have access to dual enrollment programs than their non-English Learner counterparts.

However, high schools with higher concentrations of ELs were less likely to offer dual enrollment than high schools with lower concentrations of ELs. More than 60 percent of low EL concentration high schools offered dual enrollment in 2013–14, while 42 percent of high schools with medium concentrations of ELs and only 30 percent of high schools with high concentrations of ELs offered dual enrollment 2013–14.

                  Sixty-four percent of high school students in 2013–14 were enrolled in high schools that offered dual enrollment. However, reflecting the data that suggest that ELs were less likely to be able to access dual enrollment options than non-ELs, ELs were less likely to be enrolled in schools that offered dual enrollment. Just over half - 53 percent - of ELs in high school were enrolled in high schools that offered dual enrollment in 2013–14. In comparison, 64 percent of non-ELs were enrolled in high schools that offered dual enrollment options.

                  Almost all ELs in 2014–15 participated in an LIEP. Out of the 4.8 million ELs in 2014–15, 97 percent, or more than 4.6 million, participated in an LIEP. Of those particiating in an LIEP, the vast majority - 78 percent, or 3.6 million, were Hispanic; 11 percent, or about 500,000 were Asian; and 6 percent, or about 270,000 were White. The high percentage of ELs participating in an LIEP suggests that these programs are reaching the intended population.

                  Data in this story represent the 50 states and the District of Columbia.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Figure and source notes throughout the story identify the data sources used. With the exception of the EDFacts data used to estimate the EL preschool-age population, all data used in this story are publicly available.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Data used in this story may differ slightly from other published reports due to the removal of data from schools with data quality concerns. This includes schools with missing, partial, and internally inconsistent data (e.g., more ELs than total students or more students enrolled in a course than enrolled in a school).

                <h3 id="mapnotes" style="font-size: 15px;" class="line">Definitions</h3>
                <p>
                  <strong>Preschool</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, includes preschool programs and services for children ages 3 through 5.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Preschool-aged children</strong> includes children enrolled in preschool as well as children not enrolled in preschool. This story estimates the size of this population using the number of children enrolled in grades 1 or 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Algebra I</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that includes the study of properties and operations of the real number system; evaluating rational algebraic expressions; solving and graphing first degree equations and inequalities; translating word problems into equations; operations with and factoring of polynomials; and solving simple quadratic equations. Algebra I is a foundation course leading to higher-level mathematics courses, including Geometry and Algebra II. The analyses in the story include only Algebra I courses for students in grade 7 or 8.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Calculus</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that includes the study of derivatives, differentiation, integration, the definite and indefinite integral, and applications of calculus.  Typically, students have previously attained knowledge of precalculus topics (some combination of trigonometry, elementary functions, analytic geometry, and math analysis). The CRDC data calculus courses for students in grades 9-12.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Chemistry</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that includes studying the composition, properties, and reactions of substances. These courses typically explore such concepts as the behaviors of solids, liquids, and gases; acid/base and oxidation/reduction reactions; and atomic structure. Chemical formulas and equations and nuclear reactions are also studied. The CRDC data chemistry courses for students in grades 9-12.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Physics</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that involves the study of the forces and laws of nature affecting matter, such as equilibrium, motion, momentum, and the relationships between matter and energy. The study of physics includes examination of sound, light, and magnetic and electric phenomena. The CRDC data physics courses for students in grades 9-12.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Dual enrollment/dual credit programs</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, provide opportunities for high school students to take college-level courses offered by colleges, and earn concurrent credit toward a high school diploma and a college degree while still in high school.  These programs are for high school-enrolled students who are academically prepared to enroll in college and are interested in taking on additional coursework.  For example, students who want to study subjects not offered at their high school may seek supplemental education at colleges nearby.  Dual enrollment/dual credit programs do not include the Advanced Placement (AP) program or the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. The collection of these data was new for 2013-14. It includes only those schools with students in grades 9-12.
