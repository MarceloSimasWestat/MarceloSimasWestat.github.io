                    The achievement gap between English learners (ELs) and their English proficient peers is well documented, including lower scores on standardized tests and graduation rates.<sup>1</sup> Because the early years are critical for children’s later academic success, this story begins with an examination of ELs’ access to and enrollment in preschool.<sup>2</sup> Next, because research has shown positive relationships between advanced coursework in high school and outcomes such as high school graduation and postsecondary participation and completion, the story examines ELs’ access to college preparatory courses and dual enrollment programs.<sup>3</sup>

                    Participation in high-quality early learning programs, such as center-based preschool, improves school readiness and may have long-term educational benefits.<sup>4</sup> Studies have found that ELs gain more from their preschool experiences than their non-EL peers.<sup>5</sup> Preschool participation also provides early exposure to English, which in turn may lower the age at which full proficiency is achieved. Reaching proficiency prior to first grade has been shown to reduce or eliminate reading and math achievement gaps between ELs and non-ELs.<sup>6</sup> 
                </p>
                <p class="afterHeader">
                    The analyses below primarily use data from the 2013–14 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) to explore ELs’ exposure to preschool, including the extent to which:

                <ul>
                    <li>ELs had access to public preschool and</li>

                </ul>
                <p class="afterHeader">
                    In these analyses, access to preschool is defined as enrollment in districts that provided preschool programs or services for children ages 3 through 5. Given the available national-level data, district enrollment is limited to the number of students in schools with preschool or early elementary grades (any of grades preschool through grade 2) rather than the number of students across all schools in the district. For example, we excluded enrollment from schools with only high school grades.

                <p class="afterHeader">
                    Because cost can be a barrier to access, the analyses also examine access to and enrollment in free public preschool. In addition, because more time in preschool may increase school readiness, the analyses also examine access to and enrollment in full-day and part-day preschool.<sup>7</sup>

                  Students who participate in more rigorous courses are more likely to experience positive academic outcomes, such as attending and graduating from college, than students who do not participate.<sup>8</sup> However, research has demonstrated unequal participation by ELs in such courses.<sup>9</sup> They may not attend schools that offer these courses or may enroll in less academically rigorous courses due to their lower levels of proficiency in English and on state assessments. Other factors that may inhibit ELs’ enrollment in rigorous courses include lack of course prerequisites (e.g., Algebra I).<sup>10</sup>

                  Algebra I is a “gatekeeper” math course that students must pass to be prepared for higher-level math courses. Seventy percent of ELs had access to Algebra I in grade 7 or 8, defined as attending a school that offered the course in those grades. However, only 4 percent of ELs enrolled in the Algebra I. In comparison, nearly three-quarters of non-ELs were in schools that offered Algebra I in grade 7 or 8, and 9 percent enrolled in the course. A similar pattern was found for advanced math and science courses. A majority of ELs and non-ELs were in high schools that offered Physics, Chemistry, or Calculus. However, ELs enrolled in these courses at lower rates than non-ELs.

                  Students in schools that do not offer Algebra I or advanced math or science courses do not have the opportunity to take these courses. Schools with high concentrations of EL students were less likely than schools with low concentrations to offer these courses. For example, 55 percent of schools with grades 7 or 8 and a high concentration of ELs offered Algebra I compared with 72 percent of schools with a low concentration of ELs. The pattern was the same for high schools offering Physics, Chemistry, or Calculus.

                  Although ELs accounted for 7 percent of students enrolled in schools that offered Algebra I in grade 7 or 8, they accounted for only 3 percent of students enrolled in the course. The pattern was similar for advanced math and science courses. For example, in high schools that offered Calculus, ELs accounted for 5 percent of enrollment, but less than 1 percent of students enrolled in the course.

                  Dual enrollment programs provide opportunities for high school students to take college-level courses offered by colleges, and earn concurrent credit toward a high school diploma and a college degree. As noted in the CRDC, these programs are for students who are academically prepared to enroll in college and are interested in taking additional coursework; for example, a subject not offered at their high school. Students in dual enrollment may be more likely to attend college after graduating<sup>11</sup> and experience other academic benefits such as attaining higher grades in college and accumulating credits toward college graduation at a faster pace than those who did not participate in dual enrollment.<sup>12</sup>

                  Almost all ELs in 2014–15 participated in an LIEP. Out of the 4.8 million ELs in 2014–15, 97 percent, or more than 4.6 million, participated in an LIEP. Of those particiating in an LIEP, the vast majority - 78 percent, or 3.6 million, were Hispanic; 11 percent, or about 500,000 were Asian; and 6 percent, or about 270,000 were White. The high percentage of ELs participating in an LIEP suggests that these programs are reaching the intended population.

                  Preschool, rigorous coursework, and dual enrollment programs may improve the readiness of students for key phases of the education pipeline. While public preschool programs were widely available to ELs through their school districts, preschool-aged EL children enrolled in preschool at a lower rate than their non-EL peers. ELs were underrepresented in districts that only provided preschool at cost, which may suggest that cost is a barrier to preschool. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  EL high school students had broad access to Algebra I and advanced math and science courses, but were less likely to enroll in these courses than non-ELs. ELs also were less represented among students enrolled in these courses than expected given their representation in school as a whole. This analysis did not explore whether factors such as lack of course prerequisites contributed to ELs’ lower enrollment in these courses. Yet, we do know that access to Algebra I and advanced math and science courses was uneven across high schools. High schools with high percentages of ELs offered these courses at lower rates than high schools with lower EL percentages. Access to dual enrollment programs across high schools followed a similar pattern.

                <p>
                  <strong>Full-day preschool</strong> is a program that a child attends each weekday for approximately six hours or more. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Preschool-aged children</strong> includes children enrolled in preschool as well as children not enrolled in preschool. This story estimates the size of this population using the number of children enrolled in grades 1 or 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>High school</strong>, as used in this story map, is a school that includes any of grades 9 through 12. For some of these schools, enrollment may include students in lower grades.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Algebra I</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that includes the study of properties and operations of the real number system; evaluating rational algebraic expressions; solving and graphing first degree equations and inequalities; translating word problems into equations; operations with and factoring of polynomials; and solving simple quadratic equations.

                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Calculus</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that includes the study of derivatives, differentiation, integration, the definite and indefinite integral, and applications of calculus.  Typically, students have previously attained knowledge of precalculus topics (some combination of trigonometry, elementary functions, analytic geometry, and math analysis). The CRDC data for Calculus courses are for students in grades 9-12.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Chemistry</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that includes studying the composition, properties, and reactions of substances. These courses typically explore such concepts as the behaviors of solids, liquids, and gases; acid/base and oxidation/reduction reactions; and atomic structure. Chemical formulas and equations and nuclear reactions are also studied. The CRDC data for Chemistry courses are for students in grades 9-12.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Physics</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that involves the study of the forces and laws of nature affecting matter, such as equilibrium, motion, momentum, and the relationships between matter and energy. The study of physics includes examination of sound, light, and magnetic and electric phenomena. The CRDC data for Physics courses are for students in grades 9-12.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Enrollment in schools with the relevant grades</strong> includes all students enrolled in the school, excluding those enrolled in preschool.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Dual enrollment/dual credit programs</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, provide opportunities for high school students to take college-level courses offered by colleges, and earn concurrent credit toward a high school diploma and a college degree while still in high school.  These programs are for high school-enrolled students who are academically prepared to enroll in college and are interested in taking on additional coursework.  For example, students who want to study subjects not offered at their high school may seek supplemental education at colleges nearby.  Dual enrollment/dual credit programs do not include the Advanced Placement (AP) program or the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. The collection of these data was new for 2013-14. It includes only those schools with students in grades 9-12.
