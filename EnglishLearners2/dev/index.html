                <p>
                  Access to early learning programs such as preschool can have long-term educational benefits. For English learners … For example, a 2012 study found that English Learners participating in center-based care and, particularly, high-quality care, exhibit improvements in early reading skills,<sup>1</sup> while other studies suggest that dual-language learner children may benefit more from center-based care relative to their English-speaking peers.<sup>2</sup> Furthermore, dual-language learners can exhibit rapid growth in early learning and improved English proficiency and other academic skills.<sup>3</sup>

                  The analyses below use the 2013–14 Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) to explore EL’s enrollment in and access to preschool. The CRDC defines preschool as preschool programs and services for children ages 3 to 5.

                  Ninety-three percent of ELs in schools with preschool or early elementary grades were enrolled in districts that provided preschool programs or services compared to 89 percent of non-ELs. ELs were also somewhat more likely than non-ELs to have access to free preschool and full-day preschool programs and services; 87 percent of ELs enrolled in districts that provided free preschool compared with 81 percent of non-ELs, while 59 percent of ELs enrolled in districts that provided full-day preschool compared with 55 percent of non-ELs.

                  Students who participate in more rigorous courses are more likely to experience positive academic outcomes, such as attending and graduating from college, than students who do not participate.<sup>4</sup> However, research has demonstrated unequal participation by ELs in such courses.<sup>5</sup> They may not attend schools that offer these courses or may enroll in less academically rigorous courses due to their lower levels of proficiency in English and on state assessments.<sup>a</sup> Other factors that may inhibit ELs’ enrollment in rigorous courses include lack of course prerequisites (e.g., Algebra I) and other factors.<sup>6</sup>

                  In 2013–14, 70 percent of ELs were enrolled in schools that offered Algebra I in grade 7 or 8, but only 4 percent enrolled in the course. In comparison, nearly three-quarters of non-ELs were in schools that offered Algebra I in those grades, and 9 percent enrolled in the course. Similarly, most ELs and non-ELs were enrolled in schools with any of grades 9 through 12 that offered Physics, Chemistry, or Calculus. However, non-ELs were more likely than ELs to be enrolled in these courses.

                  For example, 72 percent of schools that included grade 7 or 8 and had a low concentration of ELs offered Algebra I compared with 55 percent of high EL concentration schools.  The pattern was the same for schools with any of grades 9 through 12 that offered Physics, Chemistry, or Calculus.

The pattern was similar for advanced math and science courses. For example, in schools that offered Calculus, ELs accounted for 5 percent of enrollment but less than 1 percent of the students enrolled in Calculus.

                  Dual enrollment programs provide opportunities for high school students to take college-level courses offered by colleges, and earn concurrent credit toward a high school diploma and a college degree. As noted in the CRDC, these programs are for students who are academically prepared to enroll in college and are interested in taking additional coursework; for example, a subject not offered at their high school. Students in dual enrollment may be more likely to attend college after graduating<sup>7</sup> and experience other academic benefits such as attaining higher grades in college and accumulating credits toward college graduation at a faster pace than those who did not participate in dual enrollment.<sup>8</sup>

                  Almost all ELs in 2014–15 participated in an LIEP. Out of the 4.8 million ELs in 2014–15, 97 percent, or more than 4.6 million, participated in an LIEP. Of those particiating in an LIEP, the vast majority - 78 percent, or 3.6 million, were Hispanic; 11 percent, or about 500,000 were Asian; and 6 percent, or about 270,000 were White. The high percentage of ELs participating in an LIEP suggests that these programs are reaching the intended population.

                  Figure and source notes throughout the story identify the data sources used. With the exception of the EDFacts data used to estimate the EL preschool-age population, all data used in this story are publicly available.

                <p>
                  Data used in this story may differ slightly from other published reports due to the removal of data from schools with data quality concerns. This includes schools with missing, partial, and internally inconsistent data (e.g., more ELs than total students or more students enrolled in a course than enrolled in a school).

                <p>
                  <strong>Preschool</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, includes preschool programs and services for children ages 3 through 5.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Preschool-aged children</strong> includes children enrolled in preschool as well as children not enrolled in preschool. This story estimates the size of this population using the number of children enrolled in grades 1 or 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Algebra I</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that includes the study of properties and operations of the real number system; evaluating rational algebraic expressions; solving and graphing first degree equations and inequalities; translating word problems into equations; operations with and factoring of polynomials; and solving simple quadratic equations. Algebra I is a foundation course leading to higher-level mathematics courses, including Geometry and Algebra II. The analyses in the story include only Algebra I courses for students in grade 7 or 8.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Calculus</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that includes the study of derivatives, differentiation, integration, the definite and indefinite integral, and applications of calculus.  Typically, students have previously attained knowledge of precalculus topics (some combination of trigonometry, elementary functions, analytic geometry, and math analysis). The CRDC data for Calculus courses are for students in grades 9-12.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Chemistry</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that includes studying the composition, properties, and reactions of substances. These courses typically explore such concepts as the behaviors of solids, liquids, and gases; acid/base and oxidation/reduction reactions; and atomic structure. Chemical formulas and equations and nuclear reactions are also studied. The CRDC data for Chemistry courses are for students in grades 9-12.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Physics</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, is a (college-preparatory) course that involves the study of the forces and laws of nature affecting matter, such as equilibrium, motion, momentum, and the relationships between matter and energy. The study of physics includes examination of sound, light, and magnetic and electric phenomena. The CRDC data for Physics courses are for students in grades 9-12.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Dual enrollment/dual credit programs</strong>, as defined in the Civil Rights Data Collection, provide opportunities for high school students to take college-level courses offered by colleges, and earn concurrent credit toward a high school diploma and a college degree while still in high school.  These programs are for high school-enrolled students who are academically prepared to enroll in college and are interested in taking on additional coursework.  For example, students who want to study subjects not offered at their high school may seek supplemental education at colleges nearby.  Dual enrollment/dual credit programs do not include the Advanced Placement (AP) program or the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. The collection of these data was new for 2013-14. It includes only those schools with students in grades 9-12.
